# 7-Days-of-Code-Challenge
I manage to design the smart journal app in seven days
When you install the app for the first time you have to signup with an email address and a password
If you already have an account, the user will just sign in with his account then update his/her journal
To add a story the user clics on the plus button on the menu bar.
The user can also delete the stories
